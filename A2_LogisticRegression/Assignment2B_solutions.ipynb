    "Logistic regression is one type of a larger family of statistical models called Generalized Linear Models (or GLMs) for binary data. Generalized Linear Models are a generalization of linear models (duh!) when the dependent variable is not a continuous variable (remember in Assignment 1 the dependent variable was an angle), for example: binary data, categorical data, count data, etc. In these cases, the assumption that observations correspond to the model plus some gaussian noise does not work. We will get back to GLMs when running regressions of spiking activity (Assignment 4).\n",

The binomial distribution simply means that we are observing binary data. \"GLM with binomial distribution\" is almost a synonym for \"logistic regression\" (side note: \"probit regression\" is another type of \"GLM with binomial distribution\" which is in practice is almost equivalent to logistic regression, as the only thing that changes is the exact shape of the sigmoidal function)."

That is, as in part A of the assignment, our statistical model can also predict the responses for many other displacements beyond the values that were tested. This is the predictive power of the model, what is exploited in machine learning. <br>\n",
    "**Let's plot the fitted psychometric curve**, i.e. the prediction curve for a linearly spaced list of x's (probe-target distances) in the range between -40 and 40 degrees. The fitted model can give you the predicted y's for those x's with the function `res.predict` in the results `res` of our model. Notice that because we defined our model with a formula, `predict` needs to get as argument also a Pandas DataFrame with a column *'displacement'* that contains the new *x* values on which we want to get predictions."

    "Now that we split the data between perceptual trials and memory trials (i.e. short and long delays), we obtain that the two-regressor model now shows a significant main effect for the *dist_distractor* factor, in memory trials only. This was previously non-significant in the full model. If we look closely, we will see that the value of the coefficient for *dist_distractor* is now positive for short delays (0.0013)  and negative for long delays (-0.0012). This is indicating that the bias induced by non-targets may be different for each of these 2 conditions: repulsive for short delays (or non-significant), and attractive for long delays. This is the interaction that we found significant and this would explain that when we run the full model the main factor *dist_distractor* has a vanishing coefficient because attractions and repulsions form the different delay conditions cancel one another.\n",

    "### 3.2 Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)\n",
    "Here, we treated participants as fixed effects of our design, and this is good to make inferences about our sample population. However, to make more general inferences on the larger population that our sample represents, we should treat the subject factor as a random effect. This would then correspond to a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The terms *mixed* reflects the fact that the model includes both *fixed effects* (effects that are stable in the population, generally the ones we're interested in) and *random effects* (effects that vary between individuals). GLMMs are advanced regression methods implemented in the *lmer* function from the *pymer4* package. However there are many more packages for running these models in R, and here we'll see how to run R from Python. You can learn about this on your own, it is not part of the assignment, but you can play below to try to run such a model on this data (this is what was done in the orginal article by Almeida et al 2015)."

However, this is maybe not the most intuitive way that we expect our participants to differ from one another. It makes maybe more sense to think that what will really be different from subject to subject is the sensibility in detecting small displacements of the probe. Some people will be very sensitive to small displacements, while others will need longer distances to perceive clearly the shift. In other words, some subjects will discriminate better than others. The sensibility is the maximal slope of the psychometric function, and it is directly related to the logistic regression parameter for the `displacement` variable. Here is how would you enter this subject-to-subject variability in the model."
