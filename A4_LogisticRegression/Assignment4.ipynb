    "Logistic regression is one type of a larger family of statistical models called Generalized Linear Models (or GLMs) for binary data. Generalized Linear Models are a generalization of linear models (duh!) when the dependent variable is not a continuous variable (remember in Assignment 1 the dependent variable was an angle), for example: binary data, categorical data, count data, etc. In these cases, the assumption that observations correspond to the model plus some Gaussian noise does not work. We will see more examples of GLMs when we will anlalyze spiking data in one of the next assignments.\n",

If we look closely, we will see that the value of the coefficient for *dist_distractor* is now positive for short delays (0.0013)  and negative for long delays (-0.0012). This is indicating that the bias induced by non-targets may be different for each of these 2 conditions: repulsive for short delays (or non-significant), and attractive for long delays.

    "Here, we treated participants as fixed effects of our design, and this is good to make inferences about our sample population. However, to make more general inferences on the larger population that our sample represents, we should treat the subject factor as a random effect. This would then correspond to a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The terms *mixed* reflects the fact that the model includes both *fixed effects* (effects that are stable in the population, generally the ones we're interested in) and *random effects* (effects that vary between individuals). GLMMs are advanced regression methods implemented in the *lmer* function from the *pymer4* package. However there are many more packages for running these models in R, and here we'll see how to run R from Python. You can learn about this on your own, it is not part of the assignment, but you can play below to try to run such a model on this data (this is what was done in the orginal article by Almeida et al 2015)."

    "This model only considered subject-to-subject variability coming from systematic CW/CCW biases in the responses (the term `(1|subj)` considers variability in the intercept, which determines CW/CCW biases in the responses of individual participants). However, this is maybe not the most intuitive way that we expect our participants to differ from one another. It makes maybe more sense to think that what will really be different from subject to subject is the sensibility in detecting small displacements of the probe. Some people will be very sensitive to small displacements, while others will need longer distances to perceive clearly the shift. In other words, some subjects will discriminate better than others. The sensibility is the maximal slope of the psychometric function, and it is directly related to the logistic regression parameter for the `displacement` variable. Here is how would you enter this subject-to-subject variability in the model."
