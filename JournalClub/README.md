# Journal Club

In this assignment, you will present 6 recent articles related to data analysis in neuroscience in groups of 3-5 students:
- [Button et al, Nature Review Neuroscience 2013](Button_2013.pdf): "Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience". 5 presenters, 12 minutes.
- [Padoa-Schiappa, Neuron 2022](PadoaSchiappa_2022.pdf): "Logistic analysis of choice data: A primer". Until Figure 4 only. 5 presenters, 12 minutes. 
- [Calin-Jageman & Cumming, eNeuro 2019](Calin-Jageman_2019.pdf): "Estimation for Better Inference in Neuroscience". 4 presenters, 10 minutes. 
- [Shinn et al, eLife 2020](Shinn_2020.pdf): "A flexible framework for simulating and fitting generalized drift-diffusion models". Until page 7 only. 4 presenters, 10 minutes.
- [Palminteri et al., TiCS 2017](Palminteri_2017.pdf): "The Importance of Falsification in Computational Cognitive Modeling". 4 presenters, 10 minutes.
- [Nieuwenhuis, Nature Neuroscience 2011](Nieuwenhuis_2011.pdf): "Erroneous analyses of interactions in neuroscience: a problem of significance". 3 presenters, 8 minutes.

The presentation will take place in classroom. Each presentation should last between 8' and 12' (depending on the number of presenters), followed by a 5-minute round of questions from the other students.
Each student is expected to ask at least one question during the session.
**Each student in each group must present one and only one slide**, so if you're 4 students there should be just 4 slides (plus one title slide).
**Rehearse** and make sure you do not use more than the allocated time.


Pick up the article you want to present by adding your name on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PjDCgRckp_BpQb1jaUFkBjol9B6MPjAf_FcF-Og41O8/edit?usp=sharing). Places are allocated on a first-come first-serve basis.
Do not exceed the number of presenters assigned to each paper.

All presentations should be uploaded (in PDF, Google Slide or PowerPoint format) to [this repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z67s2MsLPlyppAb_sQ3O1Y28ytauoop7?usp=sharing) prior to the classroom (no changes will be allowed after the class has started).
